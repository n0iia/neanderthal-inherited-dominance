# Inherited Dominance: The Legacy of the Neanderthal Genocide

This repository houses the original whitepaper for **Pauline's Principle of Inherited Dominance**, a groundbreaking hypothesis that reframes the extinction of Neanderthals by Homo sapiens as a foundational species trauma—one that continues to echo in human behavior, psychology, and social structures.

## 🔍 Overview

The paper proposes that:

- The extinction of Neanderthals was not passive, but an act of species-level violence—possibly genocide.
- This event embedded patterns of dominance, hierarchy, and violence in Homo sapiens' behavior.
- These patterns repeat across history in the form of conquest, oppression, and systemic abuse.
- A deeper understanding of this trauma can inform cultural healing, ethical frameworks, and new models of empathy.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **Inherited Dominance**: Conquest over a sibling species encoded aggression into human social systems.
- **Cycles of Abuse**: Historical oppression reflects reactivated species trauma.
- **Epigenetic Memory**: Biological echoes of interspecies violence may persist in modern behavior.
- **Cultural Repair**: Reframing Neanderthals not as primitives, but as erased kin.
