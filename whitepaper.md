# Pauline's Principle of Inherited Dominance: The Neanderthal Genocide Hypothesis

## Abstract
This paper explores Pauline's Principle of Inherited Dominance—the idea that the extinction of Neanderthals by Homo sapiens was not merely a historical event, but a species-defining trauma. This trauma embedded itself in the psyche and culture of modern humans, shaping enduring tendencies toward domination, violence, and social hierarchy. Rather than dismissing this event as distant prehistory, the paper argues that humanity continues to echo its effects—in cycles of abuse, authoritarianism, and systemic oppression. Drawing on anthropology, evolutionary psychology, genetics, and trauma theory, this framework reexamines human nature through the lens of ancestral violence and its psychological legacy.

## I. Human-Neanderthal Relations: Context and Collapse
- For tens of thousands of years, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens coexisted across Eurasia.
- Evidence of interbreeding, shared tool use, and symbolic behavior suggests periods of interaction—and possible cooperation.
- Genetic studies confirm that non-African humans today carry 1–2% Neanderthal DNA.
- Yet, within a few millennia of contact, Neanderthals vanished—archaeological signs point to displacement and violent competition.
- The hypothesis: this extinction was not passive evolution, but deliberate eradication—a prehistoric genocide of our closest relatives.

## II. Pauline's Core Principle: Inherited Dominance
- The annihilation of a sibling species left more than fossil traces—it left a psychic imprint.
- The act of conquest became an evolutionary script, shaping behaviors rooted in hierarchy, control, and exclusion.
- Pauline's Principle posits that this foundational trauma forged a loop: violence begets identity, and identity justifies further violence.
- These behaviors became embedded through natural selection, reinforced by culture, and reactivated across generations.

## III. Cycles of Abuse in Human History
- History repeats this pattern—from ancient empires to colonial regimes, from slavery to systemic inequality.
- These are not isolated failures, but recursive replays of the original domination script.
- In this view, the Neanderthal is not a footnote of evolution, but the archetypal victim—etched in our DNA, yet forgotten in our narratives.
- Pauline’s Principle gives language to the species-level trauma humans reenact: conquer, erase, repeat.

## IV. Epigenetics and Memory: The Biological Echo
- Research in epigenetics reveals that trauma can influence gene expression—and be inherited.
- Pauline’s framework suggests the Neanderthal genocide may have shaped Homo sapiens not only psychologically, but biologically.
- Traits like hypervigilance, in-group loyalty, and aggressive defense may have been selected during interspecies conflict.
- The 1–2% Neanderthal DNA we carry today becomes both a biological legacy and a moral reminder: our kin are within us, even if we silenced their voice.

## V. Toward Cultural Recognition and Repair
- Acknowledging the Neanderthal extinction as a moral and historical rupture opens the door to healing.
- Just as modern societies reflect on genocide, slavery, and colonization, we can extend our reckoning to the earliest erased.
- This is not about guilt, but integration—bringing awareness to a chapter long buried beneath triumphalist narratives.
- Cultural repair begins by naming the Neanderthal not as a primitive relic, but as a relative—our first victim, our silent ancestor.

## VI. Applications and Future Directions
- **Education**: Frame human prehistory not just as archaeology, but as moral history—centering empathy, kinship, and conflict.
- **Psychology**: Explore inherited trauma at the species level; how cycles of violence might echo from deep evolutionary scars.
- **Philosophy and Ethics**: Rethink human nature as shaped by inherited violence, rather than pure reason or divine exception.
- **Storytelling and Culture**: Rehumanize the Neanderthal through literature, film, and interactive media—tools of remembrance and repair.
- **Science**: Investigate how archaic DNA may inform social behavior—not just as artifact, but as inheritance.
